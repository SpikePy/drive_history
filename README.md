# Project to track who was driving when

## How To Use
- As a __passenger__ input how many times you participated on that day with a __negative sign in front__
- As a __driver__ input how many participants you were driving how many times that day/how many trips you helped to avoid


### Examples
1. `A` and `B` are driving with `C` to the destination and back
  - For `A` and `B` the input has to be `-2` (each)
  - For `C` input has to be `4` (as he helped to avoide 4 trips)
1. `A` and `B` are driving with `C` to the destination but only `A` is driving back home with `C`
  - `A`\`s input has to be `-2` (because he participated 2 times)
  - `B`\`s input has to be `-1` (he participated only one time that day)
  - For `C` input has to be `3` (as he helped the part save 3 trips)
1. `A` is driving with `B` as passenger to the destination and back
  - `B`\`s input has to be `-2`
  - `A`\`s input has to be `2` (as he helped the part save 2 trips)
